# Maze Game
This project was open ended; it required us to think of a creative use for a FPGA - we chose to create a maze game in Python, using pygame and numpy, and  FPGAs as the controllers to move the balls.

### My contribution
My role was in the creation of the game itself - I implemented the powerups and helped in level design. The [game.py](game.py) file contains the majority of the code for the game, with seperate files run on the FPGAs to get the accelerometer and gyroscope readings needed. The [report](Report.pdf) contains a detailed breakdown of the design choices and architecture of the game
